## Cryptanalysis

* affine.py decrypts any ciphertext that was encrypted with an affine cipher
* vigenere.py decrypts any ciphertext that was encrypted with a Vigenere cipher

## Cryptographic Attacks

* lengthExtensionAttack.py accepts a valid URL and modifies the URL so that it will execute the UnlockAllSafes command as the user

## Web Security
* xssPayload.html attacks the target website by exploiting three common classes of vulnerabilities: cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection
* To view reports on all events: python3 -m http.server 31337
